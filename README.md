# Stevens_Pass_Weather_Reminder

This python script takes weather forecasts for Stevens Pass from five different weather websites and then edits an infographic template.
After the infographic is edited, the infographic is set as the user's computer wallpaper. 
Each time the script is called, the information in the infographic is overwritten. 

This program only works for macOS with Catalina version 10.15.2 or later
Without the computer wallpaper function, this program will work in Spyder on any computer as long as the two infographic templates are inside the same folder as the program.
