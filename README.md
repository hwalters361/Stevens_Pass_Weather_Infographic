# Stevens_Pass_Weather_Reminder

This python script takes weather forecasts for Stevens Pass from five different weather websites and then edits an infographic template.
After the infographic is edited, the infographic is set as the user's computer wallpaper. 
Each time the script is called, the information in the infographic is overwritten.
