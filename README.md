# Stevens_Pass_Weather_Reminder

This python script takes weather forecasts for Stevens Pass from five different weather websites and then logs that information into Stevens-Weather-Log.txt.
That information in the text file is then used to edit an infographic. After the infographic is edited, the infographic is set as the user's computer wallpaper. 
Each time the script is called, the information in Stevens-Pass-Weather-Log.txt is overwritten.
